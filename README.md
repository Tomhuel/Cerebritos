## Description
This project was developed as a custom solution for Cerebritos. The main objective was to motivate our kids with achievements and a points system to get free puzzles. Although all development phases were completed, the project was never deployed to production due to the client's lack of action in the final stages.

## Project Status
Status: `Completed (Not deployed to production)`

Despite completing all necessary development, the project did not proceed to production. The client did not provide the required credentials for cloud service configuration (AWS) and did not make the final agreed payment, which prevented deployment and final delivery.
